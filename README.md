## Motivation

## User Stories

2. as a parent, I want to see how well my child is comprehending the material.
3. as an instructor, I would like to create quizzes so that I can give them to my class.
4. as an instructor, I would like to have quizzes created so that my workload is reduced.
5. as an instructor, I would like to have quizzes created from quizlet so that I know the quality of quiz is high.
6. as an instructor, I want to be able to have quizzes that I can re-use in future classes.
7. as a student, I want to be able to review my correct and incorrect answers to verify that I understand the material.
8. as a student, I want to be able to re-take a quiz to see if my score is improving.

* Balsamiq Mockups 3: for creating the horizontal hierarchy diagram
* Wireframe.cc: for creating our two wireframe


# Future Plans
* We were unable to add delete to the quiz or question models, which we should have. This is a feature that needs to be added in the future. Also, our group found the CSS a bit challenging, so making the app more visually appealing and user friendly is a task to work on.

## Technologies Used: 
* Command Line: Used for navigating the file system
* Source Control: Used for interacting,managing, and updating code between group members on to a git repository
* Visual Studio Code: Code editor used for our JavaScript, CSS, and HTML 
* React: Javascript library
* Bootstrap: used for creating the drop-down menu and some other CSS features

## Installation
* Web browser
* Internet connection
* Javascript support
* NPM support
